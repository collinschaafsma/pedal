# Pedal

Pedal is a fast, Webmachine based full-stack Web Framework written in Ruby for building extendable, maintainable applications quickly.
Pedal divides itself into a client server model allowing for easy de-coupling and is ideal for building Hypermedia APIs
with rich Javascript based clients. Pedal is simple and stays out of the way, while instituting proper design patterns beyond the typical
model, view, controller paradigm. Start Pedaling!
